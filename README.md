- LED 4: Inner Bottom [9, 13]

### Outer Ring (LEDs 5-12)
- LED 5: Outer Bottom Left [7, 20]
- LED 6: Outer Left Low [0, 12]
- LED 7: Outer Left High [0, 7]
- LED 8: Outer Top Left [7, 0]
- LED 9: Outer Top Right [12, 0]
- LED 10: Outer Right High [20, 7]
- LED 11: Outer Right Low [20, 12]
- LED 12: Outer Bottom Right [12, 20]

### Visual Layout Description
